#FoodWheel - analyse the first half year 

## Introduction

FoodWheel is a startup delivery service that takes away the struggle of deciding where to eat. I need to answer fiew questions:

What cuisines does FoodWheel offer? Which areas should the company search for more restaurants to partner with?
How has the average order amount changed over time? What does this say about the trajectory of the company?
How much has each customer on FoodWheel spent over the past six months? What can this tell us about the average FoodWheel customer?

For this projekt I use python 3.11 with pandas and matplotlib.

## Analyse

1. What cuisines does FoodWheel offer? Which areas should the company search for more restaurants to partner with?

As we can see on the plot FoofWeel offers following cuisines:
+ Chinese
+ American
+ Pizza
+ Vegetarian
+ Japanese
+ Italian
+ Korean

***Probably there is still some space to extend offer of vegetarian, italian, japanese and korean cuisines.***

2. How has the average order amount changed over time? What does this say about the trajectory of the company?

***As we can see on the plot there is a clear upward trend. FoodWeel has grown three times in 6 mouths.***

3. How much has each customer on FoodWheel spent over the past six months? What can this tell us about the average FoodWheel customer?

***Average FoodWheel customer spent over six months 18$ but more important is that the average customer spent grow every month. That means that new customers back to FoofWeel.***

## Conclusion

Atter 6 months from start FoodWheel has grown three times and probably that trend will continue. We can see also that many new customers come back. There is a space to expand the offer of vegetarian, italian, japanese and korean cuisine.
